# Mp3_Tag_Reader_using-c

MP3 tag reader is a software which will read and display MP3 (ID3) tag information from MP3 files. The software will be desktop based and not web based. This solution will read the given MP3 file, extract various tag information and display them via command line. This project can be extended to implement a tag editor, where-in users can modify mp3 tag information.
